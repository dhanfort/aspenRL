This repo contains all the necessary files to replicate the workflow and results of the study. 

Preprint URL: https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202501.1596/v1 

Here are the main files in this project repo:
1. A Python API script that allows interfacing of the AspemPlus in Windows OS with Python where the SAC RL is implemented: CodeLibrary_dlbf_v3.py
2. Jupyter Notebook(s) containing all the codes to implement the SAC RL workflow with AspenPlus software and retrieve the optimized design results.
3. Example results - we also provided in this repo some of the raw data results and the accompanying notebook to process the results and render them similar to the materials presented in the paper.
